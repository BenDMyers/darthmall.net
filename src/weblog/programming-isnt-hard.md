    Heydon Pickering is being silly and provocative on Twitter again, and as
    usual, he pretty much nails it.

Nailed it.

Heydon's being a bit silly and provocative again, but that doesn't mean he
doesn't make a very good point.

I only bring this up because it caused me to reflect on something I've belived
for a long time: **anyone can learn to program**. What separates programmers
from non-programmers isn't anything special about their brains, it's the choice
to spend the time on learning to write code.

We all end up choosing to spend our time and energy learning some skills at the
expense of others. Some of us focus on making music, or writing, others focus on
understanding the fundamental forces that make up the universe as we know it, or
teaching subsequent generations what we've learned thus far.

And then there are those of us that fritter away our time learning to make
computers do silly tricks. ✋
