For the first time in _years_, I had occasion to take my 27mm pancake lens off of my camera and use my 90mm.
I could feel how out of practice I was taking photos of anything other than my kid.
Still, I got a few shots I was happy with.

I’m ambivalent about zoos.
I understand that they can serve a function in conservation efforts, and that many zookeepers are doing the best they can for the animals’ well-being with the resources they have.
But seeing these animals in cages still brings me close to tears.
Sunday was the first time I’d been to a zoo since I was a child, I think.

All of that is to say that this post comes to you with mixed feelings.
Joy at getting to start working some of those photography muscles again.
Sadness at seeing these beautiful animals locked up in cages, even though it was clear that some effort had been put into making the cages nice for the animals, and giving them places to go to be away from people if they wanted.

I need to work out a way to share my photos online again, but for now, a blog post will do.

I got pretty lucky with the red panda.
Their cage was constructed so that they had a large space they could go without being seen, and that’s where all three were hanging out.
But I was standing there, waiting while the rest of the family went to the bathroom.
When the noise quieted a bit, one of the pandas paraded out and down right in front of the wires making up the front of the cage.
After everyone got out of the bathroom, we waited patiently to see if it would come out again, but it didn’t.

This is a terrible photo.
I was shooting through some really dirty glass, which is why it’s so hazy.
But this large, beautiful bear, all sacked out on some cool rocks in the shade on pretty hot day was just too much.
I couldn’t delete this photo.

The birds were my favorite part of the zoo.
The bird enclosure felt less sad than everything else.
The enclosure was larger than most of the others; especially relative to the size of the animals trapped within.
It was one large space with a net over the top so the birds were all free to roam and mix.

I love these camels, posing like they’re in a boy band.
