A few months ago I started [bullet journaling](https://bulletjournal.com/) after
my brother mentioned that he’d been doing it and that it was working well for
him.[^1] One reason bullet journalling was appealing to me was how it included
task management as part of the practice.

Shortly after graduating from college, I read [Getting Things
Done](https://gettingthingsdone.com/) and it changed how I kept track of tasks.
I found that many of the principles in the book worked well for me, and I
applied them (mostly) in a variety of digital task managers.[^2] For the most
part this worked well, but the one thing I was always really bad at was the
daily/weekly review. If I did them at all, it was usually just a cursory glance
through my lists where I’d think to myself, “yep, that looks right”.

You see, in these digital task managers, there was no obvious consequence for me
short-changing my reviews. The tasks weren’t going anywhere. If they were still
relevant, I was in no danger of losing track of them. If they were no longer
relevant, it didn’t matter that much because it’s not like they were taking up
space, and I always had systems in place to make sure that things that needed to
get done bubbled to the top automatically.

Of course, there was a consequence to skipping reviews. I was hoarding project
ideas that I wasn't really interested in because of the possibility that some
day I might find time for them. I wasn’t being honest with myself about what was
important enough to actually keep around because it was easy to just keep
everything, but as a result, looking at my projects lists was really
discouraging. It was full of things I wasn’t doing. All of these possible
projects weighed on my mind whenever I’d sit down to relax. I felt like I was
watching TV or playing games when I _could_ have been working on one of these
project ideas.

What does all of this have to do with a bullet journal? Well, since a bullet
journal is all paper, you _have_ to do regular reviews. At the very least, once
you’ve filled up a notebook and need to start a new one, you have to look
through all of your incomplete tasks in the old notebook and decide whether or
not you’re going to copy them over to the new notebook. In practice, these
reviews happen much more frequently because you’ll want to copy incomplete tasks
forward each month (or week) to a clean page so that you don’t have to keep
scouring your daily logs for incomplete tasks.

It turned out that, for me, the convenience of digital task managers was
actually undermining my motivation to do regular reviews of my tasks.[^3]
Forcing myself to review my tasks and copy them over or risk losing track of
something important was what it took to get me to start doing meaningful
reviews. On top of that, having to copy the tasks by hand adds enough friction
that I’m a little more inclined to let go of tasks and projects that I don’t
really care about anymore.

So adding some friction into my workflow actually improved the results. The lack
of automation is a feature; it’s not a problem that needs solving, it’s
an essential component for producing quality results.

News, I think, is another example where speed and efficiency may not necessarily
be a boon. If you only publish news once every 3.7 weeks, you become a lot more
thoughtful about what news is worth publishing (no more soup of the day).

Consider a more realistic example. Printing a newspaper is expensive and
time-consuming; you’re likely to do it at most twice a day. On the other hand,
publishing to a website or to Twitter costs basically nothing—what reason do you
have not to hit “Publish”?[^5] By making communication faster and “more
efficient”, we’ve eliminated a lot of the old incentives to be more thoughtful in
our communications.[^6]

I think what all of this really boils down to is: when we talk about efficiency,
we need to be specific about what we’re making efficient. Being efficient
doesn’t have to be about just making processes faster and easier. We could think
about efficiency in terms of the quality of the result relative to the amount of
work put in. I’m putting in more work managing tasks now with my bullet journal
than I was with Remember the Milk, but the results are significantly improved as
a result.

Sometimes slowing down a little to be more thoughtful can dramatically improve
your results.

    Somehow, despite my proclivity for reading about productivity methods, I
    had missed out on the bullet journal craze from a few years back.

    I’m re-reading _Getting Things Done_ at the moment and, in the updated
    version, David Allen actually warns about the risk that too much automation
    might mean you don’t check in on all of your “open loops” often enough.

    That’s not to mention the incentive to constantly publish new material to
    bring people back multiple times a day so you can show them ads.

    Of course, making publishing cheaper and easier has also eliminated some
    gate-keeping and introduced a greater diversity of voices, which I think is,
    over all, a good thing.
