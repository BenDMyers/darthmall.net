For the last ten years, I’ve been using the same image for my phone’s lock
screen / wallpaper. I made it over winter break while I was in grad school, so,
coincidentally, this is just about ten years to the day since I started using
the wallpaper.

For whatever reason, I decided it was about time to come up with some new
wallpapers that were sized for my current phone using a font I purchased last
year specifically for this purpose.
