For the last ten years, I’ve been using the same image for my phone’s lock
screen / wallpaper. I made it over winter break while I was in grad school, so,
coincidentally, this is just about ten years to the day since I started using
the wallpaper.

For whatever reason, I decided it was about time to come up with some new
wallpapers that were sized for my current phone using a font I purchased last
year specifically for this purpose: [Salbabida
Sans](https://www.behance.net/gallery/107925677/Salbabida-Sans) by Jo Malinis.

This time I came up with a few variations. I am currently using the “glow”
variant. I created a lock screen background for each that features the phrase in
pink (just like the real Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy) and a wallpaper
version that is lower contrast to avoid clashing with widgets and application
icons on your home screen.
