For the last ten years, I’ve been using the same image for my phone’s lock
screen / wallpaper. I made it over winter break while I was in grad school, so,
coincidentally, this is just about ten years to the day since I made the
wallpaper.

     alt="“Don’t Panic” rendered like a glossy sticker in round pink letters against a
          blue background">

I had just learned how to create that glossy sticker effect from my friend, Bill
Liu, during our final project for <i>Interaction Design Fundamentals</i>, so I
decided to put it to use one night in homage to Douglas Adams. I believe the
font I used was [Sniglet](https://www.theleagueofmoveabletype.com/sniglet).

This week, I decided it was about time to come up with some new wallpapers that
were sized for my current phone using a font I purchased last year specifically
for this purpose: [Salbabida
Sans](https://www.behance.net/gallery/107925677/Salbabida-Sans) by Jo Malinis.

I came up with a few variations. I created a lock screen background for each
that features the phrase in pink (just like the real Hitchhiker’s Guide to the
Galaxy) and a wallpaper version that is lower contrast to avoid clashing with
widgets and application icons on your home screen.

I’m currently using the “glow” variant, although I also quite like the “repeat”
variant. You’re welcome to download them and use them on your phone, if you
like, just please don’t make an NFT of them.
