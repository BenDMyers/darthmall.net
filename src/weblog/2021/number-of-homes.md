I originally saw this on [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/number-of-homes/).

<blockquote>
    <p>
        🏠 They say an average person lives in 11 homes in their lifetime.
        What’s your number? (I’m currently at 8🤪)

I've lived in 17 different homes. I'm too paranoid to list out the cities the
way Chris did — I'm pretty sure I've seen questions like "which of these cities
have you lived in" as a means of verifying identity. But I'll tell you the
states.

* Colorado: 10× homes
* Pennsylvania: 3× homes
* New York: 2× homes
* Maryland: 1× home
* New Jersey: 1× home
