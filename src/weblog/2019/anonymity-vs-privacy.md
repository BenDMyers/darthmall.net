    Wherein I muse about the difference between anonymity and privacy, and how
    advertisers try to conflate the two to assuage peoples concerns over
    surveillance.

The other day I was listening to [an episode][1] of Rework where they were
they were talking about their decision to switch hosting providers for their
podcast because their old provider, _Art19_, was introducing targeted
advertising to the platform. Basecamp as a company is eschewing targeted
ads because mass surveillance doesn't align with their values. üëèüëèüëè

## Don't Worry, the Data is Anonymized

The first half of the episode is an interview with the Chief Revenue Officer
of _Art19_. One of the defenses that he uses for their use of personal data to
target listeners is that the data is anonymized; they don't know who you are,
just that you belong to some demographic that they‚Äôre targeting. Setting aside
the fact that anonymized data [might][2] [not][3] [be][4], this seems to me to
miss the point. The concern is not whether or not you know that it's me you're
targeting with these ads, the concern is that the targeting itself is an
invasion of my privacy.

Privacy is about exercising control over who gets to know certain things about
me and who doesn't. This has nothing to do with anonymity. My health, my
relationship status, my sexual orientation, these are all very personal bits
of information that I should be able to decide whom I tell and whom I don't.
The objection to surveillance capitalism ‚Äî or at least my objection ‚Äî is that
it takes that agency away from me and finds out this kind of information
without my consent.

One of the examples they come back to frequently in the podcast is targeting
parents with ads related to parenting, which perfectly illustrates my point.
Whether or not I'm a parent is something that I consider to be highly
personal. Typically (as I understand it) when a person becomes pregnant, they
don't tell people outside of immediate family until they're out of their first
trimester, and the circle of people who are told slowly expands as the
pregnancy progresses.  Some people may choose to tell everyone they meet as
soon as they know, which is perfectly fine, the point is that it should be
their choice whether to keep it under their hats or broadcast it to the world.
Surveillance capitalism completely disregards whatever desire I may have
regarding who knows whether or not I'm a parent by spying on my activity and
attempting to deduce whether or not I am.

Whether you attach that information to my name or to an advertising ID is
beside the point, the point is that information about me is mine to give, not
yours to take.

## "Relevance"

The other piece of the privacy concern is that advertisers aren't gathering
all of this data for my benefit, they're doing it to use my data against me,
which, again, has absolutely nothing to do with anonymity. People in the
advertising business will always talk about how much they want to help
consumers by delivering "relevant" ads. But the only reason they care about
relevance is because irrelevant ads are guaranteed, by definition, not to
result in a sale, which is what they really care about.

When I was a kid watching cartoons on Saturday mornings the ads were all for
toys and sugary foods. Now, arguably, ads for Cinnamon Toast Crunch were
relevant to me because I like that cereal, but to pretend that just because
those ads were "relevant" to me that they were for my benefit is absurd.
General Mills was not advertising Cinnamon Toast Crunch because they had the
best interests of American children at heart, they did it because they knew
this would result in sales for them. Encouraging kids to eat sugary cereals on
a daily basis is quite obviously not for the benefit of the kids, it's for the
benefit of the company selling the cereal.

So, yes, you may not attach my name to your profile of me, but you still have
a profile of _me_, and you use that profile for your benefit, not mine. That
is an invasion of my privacy.

## Privacy Without Anonymity

It occurred to me while I was thinking about this that there is an example of
how you can maintain privacy without anonymity, and that is medical records.
My medical records are by necessity associated with me, and yet it is my
feeling that these are kept private.

First, the data in my medical records are collected with my consent and not
distributed without my consent. Second, anyone working with medical records
are bound by [laws][5] intended to protect my privacy. Finally, these records
are gathered primarily for my benefit, not the benefit of the care providers
or the insurance companies.

The way this works in practice may be imperfect, but it demonstrates to me
that anonymity is not even a necessary component of privacy, let alone
sufficient for ensuring my privacy is protected.

So when someone excuses their surveillance by claiming the data is anonymous,
that suggests to me that, at best, they don't actually understand my concerns
about privacy, or worse, they're trying to distract me from my concerns by
conflating privacy with anonymity.
