I designed and built a new website for [Science On a
Sphere™](https://sos.noaa.gov/) (SOS), replacing an old website that had grown
to span multiple databases, a two Django applications, PHP, and hand-coded HTML.
The new website is statically generated using Eleventy, with some AlpineJS used
to provide interactivity in the dataset catalog.

I met fortnightly with the rest of the SOS team to review the changes I’d made
in that time and get their feedback. Over the course of less than a year—with me
working half-time—we designed, migrated, and launched the new website.
