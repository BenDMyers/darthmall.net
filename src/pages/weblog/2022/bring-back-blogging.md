title: Bring Back Blogging
date: 2022-12-24
description: As people are abandoning Twitter, maybe it’s time to go back to writing blogs. Sign up at bringback.blog and write three posts in January. They don’t have to be long. Look at how short this post is…

I signed up for [bringback.blog](https://bringback.blog/).
I noticed that [Tom MacWright](https://macwright.com/) did, too.
The commitment seems manageable: just three blog posts in January.
I’ve already got three open drafts, at least one of which I’ll actually publish — maybe two.

I’d be happy to see a resurgence of blogs.
I think blogs are great.

Hat-tip to [Zach](https://www.zachleat.com/) and [Inês](https://ines.omg.lol/) for bringing this to my attention.
