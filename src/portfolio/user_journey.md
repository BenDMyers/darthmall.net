I designed this tool for data scientists, product owners, and designers at Spotify to
explore how Spotify's listeners navigate the various clients to find something to stream.
It provides both a high level summary of how many streams can be attributed to any page,
and a detailed view of steps taken by users to reach a stream. The application helps its
users understand how the Spotify clients are used by listeners so that they can make
better product decisions.
