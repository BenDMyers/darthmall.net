At Seed Scientific, I worked with UNICEF to design and develop a tool for
tracking the key indicators used to monitor UNICEF's polio eradication efforts in Nigeria.
At the time, Nigeria was one of three countries — along with Pakistan and Afghanistan — in
which wild polio virus still circulated. (In 2020, the [WHO certified Africa as being free
of wild
polio](https://www.who.int/news/item/25-08-2020-global-polio-eradication-initiative-applauds-who-african-region-for-wild-polio-free-certification).)

The dashboard displayed over thirty indicators and needed to highlight trends in each one.
In addition to being interactive on the web, the dashboard also needed to be printable on
a single sheet of paper so that it could be used as a hand-out for leaders of the polio
eradication initiative during briefings.
