Back at [work](https://sos.noaa.gov/) half time now. Baby's still alive (good
job me) so I'm still spending a lot time with him. I just finished reading
the [Machineries of
Empire](https://www.goodreads.com/series/160439-the-machineries-of-empire)
trilogy and ho-key-smokes I can recommend that series â€” at least the main
three books.
