# Colophon

Congratulations! You've found the most self-indulgent part of any designer's website: the
[colophon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colophon_(publishing)).

## Fonts

All of the fonts on the site are open source. This is not because I'm cheap (type design
is hard and you should pay for good fonts), but because there are a number of really great
open source font foundries that are doing excellent work and I wanted to showcase some of
these (to the best of my ability).

<dl class="flow">
    <dt class="font-heading">Sporting Grotesque</dt>
    <dd>by <a href="http://www.velvetyne.fr/fonts/sporting-grotesque/">Velvetyne</a></dd>
    <dd>Used for page titles, strong text, dates, and whatever else I feel like because I
    really love this font</dd>

    <dt class="font-condensed">GNOMON*</dt>
    <dd>by <a href="https://indestructibletype.com/Gnomon.html">Indestructible
    Type</a></dd>
    <dd>Used for section headings. I was attracted to this font because it's a cool
    experimental variable font</dd>

    <dt class="font-body">Epilogue</dt>
    <dd>by <a href="https://etceteratype.co/epilogue">Etcetera Type Co.</a></dd>
    <dd>Used for the body text. Etcetera has lots of great fonts to choose from. I'm
    hoping to find reasons to use each and every one somewhere</dd> </d>

    <dt class="font-mono">League Mono</dt>
    <dd>by Tyler Finck and <a
    href="https://www.theleagueofmoveabletype.com/league-mono">The League of Moveable
    Type</a></dd>
    <dd>Used for code snippets. The first open source foundry I ever found</dd>
</dl>

## Colors

As an added challenge, I decided to only use colors from the [CSS Color Module Level
3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colophon_(publishing)).
