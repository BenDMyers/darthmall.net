This is a tool for data scientists, product owners, and designers to explore how users on
Spotify navigate the various clients to find something to stream. It provides both a high
level summary of how many streams can be attributed to any page, and a detailed view of
steps taken by users to reach a stream. The application helps users understand how our
clients are used so that they can make better product decisions.
