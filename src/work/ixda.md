Spotify’s booth at the Interaction Design Association (IxDA) 2018 conference featured a
different little fact about visitor's listening habits each day of the conference. Along
with two other designers at Spotify, I designed and built the application that visualized
a visitor's favorite genres, the positivitiy of their musical taste, and how danceable
their music is.
