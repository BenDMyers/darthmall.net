At Seed Scientific I worked with UNICEF to design and develop a tool for
tracking the key indicators used to monitor UNICEF's polio eradication efforts in Nigeria,
one of the three endemic countries (along with Pakistan and Afghanistan). The dashboard
was both an interactive application and a printable report that could be handed out at
meetings.
