    A map of the world covered by horizontal bands in green (corn) and magenta (sugar
    cane), indicating the amount of energy produced by each crop. Below the map is a

"Energy capture" is a measure of the amount of energy per hectare produced by a crop.
Using this measure to compare the energy efficiency of corn and sugar cane, we can see how
each has evolved to grow at different latitudes. Sugar cane (pink) is more efficient in
equatorial regions, whereas corn (green) has evolved to grow more efficiently further
north.

The map uses colored bands to indicate the amount of energy capture for each crop at
different latitudes. Higher energy captures are presented as darker colors.  The
scatterplot shows the data points from which the map was generated. The red line
represents a minimum threshold of energy capture, below which data is not shown on the
map. Thus, users can set a minimum energy capture for crops on the map to see how that
affects where in the world those crops could be grown.
