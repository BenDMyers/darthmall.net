Last year I started buying music again.
Mainly I just didn‚Äôt want to be tied to any specific streaming service and their willingness/ability to support whatever operating system or hardware I want to use.
Also I want to support artists, but that‚Äôs a topic for another day.[^1]

The conundrum is always whether or not to buy something digitally or buy a physical CD.
Digital music is (probably?) better for the environment: no material production, no shipping.
But it‚Äôs nice having the CD which I can rip to whatever format I prefer.
Plus it‚Äôs cool to be able to peruse someone‚Äôs CD collection.[^2]
I worry a little about losing digital music, but I am backing up my collection to Backblaze, so‚Ä¶ ü§ûüèª
Anyway, I think I‚Äôve worked my way around to a [priority of constituencies](https://www.w3.org/TR/html-design-principles/#priority-of-constituencies) of sorts for music purchases.

If I‚Äôm at a show, I‚Äôll purchase a CD there.
This seems great because I get a little memento of the show, and my understanding is artists see more money from merch purchased at a show than elsewhere.

Next preference would be if the band has a shop where they sell their own music.
Hopefully they see a good chunk of these sales as well.

Bandcamp is my third choice because they have a reputation for taking a small cut and giving most of the money to the artists.[^3]

Next I‚Äôll go to an indie music store, if there is one.
This often takes the form of buying used CDs on [Alibris](https://www.alibris.com/music).
If I had a good local music store, this would probably be higher on the list.

If all else fails, I might go to a larger retailer like Amazon or 7Digital.
So far, though, it hasn‚Äôt really come to this.

Mostly this ‚Äúpriority of constituencies‚Äù answers the digital vs physical question for me.
At a show, or in a shop, I‚Äôm buying a CD.
On Bandcamp I‚Äôm buying digital music.
It sometimes gets a little tricky on band‚Äôs stores because they might offer both.[^4]

Anyway, the moral of the story is: buy more music, if you can.
It‚Äôs great having a collection of music that isn‚Äôt going anywhere and that I can be reasonably certain is not being monitored by some company as part of an advertising profile.

[^3]: Some artists, like [Jason Isbell and the 400 Unit](https://jasonisbell.bandcamp.com/music) record their live shows and put them up on Bandcamp. Which I think is pretty cool.
[^4]: Or if they‚Äôre weird like Trent Reznor, they only sell vinyl.
